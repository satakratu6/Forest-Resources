    <p>At present, a little over 21 per cent of India’s land area is classified as forest. India has about 64 million hectare of forest cover (of which 59% for­est is dense, 40% is open and 1% is coastal man­grove) [FAO, 2005].

      It is further repeated that 65 per cent of the India’s forest wealth is administered solely by the government; another 27 per cent re­served for community and indigenous groups, (through joint forest management) and remaining 8 per cent of forest land is managed by private individuals on farms. <br> <br><br>

      The average stocking level of forest in India is 74 cubic meter per hectare much lower than 113 cubic meter per hectare in other developing countries. <br> <br><br>

      The pressure on India’s forest come from a variety of sources, including—the increase in population, from 390 million in 1950 to 1 billion in 2001, the loss of the 4.5 million hectares forest area since 1950 through agricultural conversion and other uses, the high percentage (78%) of forest subject to heavy grazing, exposure of half of all forests to risk from fires, shifting cultivation af­fect over 10 million hectares and encroaching of forest area by environmental victims/refuges. The demand of timber and fuel-wood has increased tre­mendously over past couple of decades and thus pressure of wealth cover is extremely high. <br> <br><br>

      In spite of such constrains, during 1990-2000, India is the only country in south Asia with a posi­tive increase in forest cover of 38,000 hectares.

      Deforestation is global concern, over 60% of the original natural forest has been cleared and the remaining forest is threatened by logging, mining and other large scale development projects. The rate of deforestation in tropics is extremely high. Being a tropical country with high population growth, India showed massive de­forestation. <br> <br><br>


      During past 50 years more than 40% forest cover has been lost during this period. This kind of deforestation is connected with severe loss of biodiversity. It is estimated that the active ingredients for 25% of the world’s prescriptive drugs are substances derived from plants, most of which grow in tropical forests and the esti­mated value of such commercial drugs is around $100 billion per year.
      
      </p>
      <h2>Forest Cover:-</h2>
      <p><b>Forest cover</b> is the total geographical area declared as forest by the government. As of 2021, the total forest cover in India is 80.9 million hectares , which is 24.62 percent of the total geographical area.[2] There is a 1,540 sq.km increase in forest cover over 2019. Madhya Pradesh has the highest forest cover as per the area followed by the Arunachal Pradesh. Mizoram has the highest forest cover in terms of percentage of total geographical area.

        Ministry of the environment forest and climate change used the mid resolution satellite data on LISS-III data from Indian remote sensing satellite. Minister of environment forest and climate change Bhupendra Yadav released the Indian forest survey report 2021-22 on the 13 January 2022.
        
        As per the report, 17 Indian states have a forest cover over 33%.</p> <br><br>

      <h2>Pyramid of Forest resources:-</h2>
      <p>The Pyramid of Forest Resources is a conceptual model that can be applied to different regions of the world, including tropical regions, temperate regions, subarctic regions, and arctic regions, to illustrate the hierarchical structure of forest resources based on their abundance, accessibility, and economic value. Here's a description of each pyramid for these regions: <br><br>

        <b>1. Pyramid of Tropical Regions:</b>
        At the base of the pyramid are non-timber forest resources, such as fruits, nuts, and medicinal plants. Above that are low-value timber resources, such as small-diameter trees and wood waste. The middle layer represents high-value timber resources, such as large-diameter trees and high-quality wood products. At the top of the pyramid are the ecosystem services provided by forests, such as carbon sequestration, watershed protection, and biodiversity conservation. <br><br>
        
        <b>2. Pyramid of Temperate Regions:</b>
        At the base of the pyramid are non-timber forest resources, such as mushrooms and berries. Above that are low-value timber resources, such as small-diameter trees and wood waste. The middle layer represents high-value timber resources, such as hardwoods and high-quality wood products. At the top of the pyramid are the ecosystem services provided by forests, such as air and water purification, wildlife habitat, and recreational. <br><br>
        <b>3. Pyramid of Subarctic Regions:</b>
        At the base of the pyramid are non-timber forest resources, such as berries and lichens. Above that are low-value timber resources, such as small-diameter trees and wood waste. The middle layer represents high-value timber resources, such as spruce and pine trees. At the top of the pyramid are the ecosystem services provided by forests, such as climate regulation, soil stabilization, and wildlife habitat. <br><br>
        
        <b>4. Pyramid of Arctic Regions:</b>
        At the base of the pyramid are non-timber forest resources, such as berries and mosses. Above that are low-value timber resources, such as small-diameter trees and shrubs. The middle layer represents high-value timber resources, such as birch and aspen trees. At the top of the pyramid are the ecosystem services provided by forests, such as carbon sequestration, wildlife habitat, and cultural values. <br><br>
        
        The Pyramid of Forest Resources highlights the importance of sustainable forest management practices that balance the economic, social, and environmental values of forest resources in different regions of the world. By understanding the different types of resources and their relationships, we can make informed decisions about how to use and protect these valuable assets for future generations.</p> <br><br>

    <h2>Forest Resouces Economic Significance</h2>
    <p>Forests are the foundation of many industries, including timber, processed wood, paper, rubber, fruits, etc. Forests supply various products and services, including food, fodder, lumber, rubber, latex, resins, waxes, steroids, lubricants, flavourings, dyes, incense, and fibres. Many of these substances may be acquired sustainably, which increases the forest’s long-term resource value.

      The economic value of forest biodiversity is enormous. The forest’s diverse flora and fauna are critical to several life-sustaining things, like medications and insecticides. Forests have economic value because they help to stabilize the environment. For example, forests that prevent soil erosion save a potential cost of erosion management.</p>

    <h2>Forest Resources Ecological Significance</h2>
    <p>Forest ecological services are environmental processes that directly benefit humans. Critical ecological services include carbon storage and absorption, watershed preservation, and biodiversity conservation. Plants absorb carbon from the atmosphere and return oxygen to the environment through photosynthesis. As a result, forests reduce and keep carbon out of the atmosphere. This maintains the earth’s suitability for life.

      Forests also have a significant impact on hydrological processes. Forests with large water absorption and retention capacity can sometimes convert irregular precipitation into a more consistent water flow from catchment areas. As a result, if forests are nearby, flooding due to extreme weather and rainfall may be reduced.
      
      Forests are essential for biodiversity as a habitat for other species. Forests are home to some of the most biodiversity-rich ecosystems on the planet. They provide habitat for an estimated 90% of threatened and endangered species. ... Read more at: https://www.studyiq.com/articles/forest-resources/</p>

      <h4>Watershed preservation</h4>
      <h2>Forest Resources Socio-Cultural Significance</h2>

      <p>Millions of people live in forests worldwide, and many of them rely on forests for survival. Furthermore, many people have strong cultural and spiritual ties to the forests. Many indigenous people understand how to sustain and use forest resources because of their long-standing connection to forests. For example, Sundarbans woodcutters and honey collectors have developed traditional cultural practices for customary resource use. They ensure that young bees are never killed.

      <h2>Types of Forest Resources in India:</h2>
      <p>Because of unique geographical locations and cli­matic diversities, the forest types of India are highly variable. A total of fourteen major classes of for­est are found in diverse region of the Indian terri­tories.</p>
      <h2>There are as follows:</h2>

    <h2>Conclusion:-</h2>
    Effective management and conservation of forest resources are crucial for sustaining ecological, social, and economic systems around the world. A forest resources project can help address critical issues related to forest management and conservation, including the protection of forest ecosystems, the promotion of sustainable forest practices, and the mitigation of climate change impacts. Such projects may involve collaboration among various stakeholders, including governments, NGOs, local communities, and private sector organizations. They may also require innovative approaches that take into account the unique challenges and opportunities of different forest ecosystems. Successful forest resources projects should be designed with clear objectives, measurable targets, and robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. They should also engage with local communities and prioritize their involvement in decision-making processes. By adopting a holistic and collaborative approach, forest resources projects can contribute significantly to the protection and sustainable use of forest resources for current and future generations.
